Runners are tools which process single or multiple HTML files, generate
the typical colorized output and write summaries.
</p>

<p>
If an input table uses the alias feature, it is required to use a runner of this
package.
</p>

<p>
There are several runners: the {@link fitgoodies.runners.DirectoryRunner} runs all
HTML files in a given directory, including its children. The
{@link fitgoodies.runners.FileRunner} is like the original fit FileRunner and
runs a single file.
