<p>
    This package allows fit to convert Strings into Objects. Fit needs to convert your
    HTML table into objects to be able to compare a cell value with an object's value.
    This is done via a parse method. Fit can parse numbers and strings.
</p>

<p>
    This package provides tools to extend the parse features. This makes it possible
    to add parsers for custom data types. A parser must implement
    {@link de.cologneintellicende.fitgoodies.typehandler.TypeHandler} and can be registered via java code using
    {@link de.cologneintellicende.fitgoodies.typehandler.SetupFixture} or via HTML using
    {@link de.cologneintellicende.fitgoodies.typehandler.TypeHandlerFactory<br/>
    All Parsers in this namespace are registered by default.
