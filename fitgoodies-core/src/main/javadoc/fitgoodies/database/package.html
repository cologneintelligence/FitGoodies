    This packages allows the user to setup a database connection and query a table
    without writing a single line of code.
</p>

<p>
    You can set the connection details using a
    {@link fitgoodies.database.SetupFixture} or the {@link fitgoodies.database.SetupHelper}
    and query a table using a {@link fitgoodies.database.TableFixture}.
</p>

<p>
    If you already have a <code>java.sql.ResultSet</code>, you can check its content
    without the need to setup a database connection. Use the
    {@link fitgoodies.database.ResultSetFixture} for this purpose.
