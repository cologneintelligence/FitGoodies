    This package allows it to receive e-mails and check their content.
    A connection can be set up using {@link fitgoodies.mail.SetupFixture} via HTML
    or using {@link fitgoodies.mail.SetupHelper} via java. After that, a
    {@link fitgoodies.mail.MailFixture} can be used to analyze the content of the
    latest mail on the specified account. <em>The mail will be deleted, so use a
    separate test account!</em>
</p>

<p>
    FitGoodies does not bring an own implementation of pop3/imap. These classes
    require the JavaMail package, which can be downloaded from SUN.
