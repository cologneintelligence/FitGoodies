<p>
    This package contains classes which generate new classes at runtime. These classes can
    be used to compare items in a {@link fitgoodies.RowFixture}, which are not simple
    classes with public fields.
</p>

<p>
    The {@link fitgoodies.dynamic.ResultSetWrapper} takes a <code>ResultSet</code>
    and generates a <code>RowFixture</code> compatible object array.
</p>
