    Aliases enable a user to type less! After defining an alias, a fixture can be
    used by specifying its alias name instead of its fully qualified class name.
</p>

<p>
    Aliases require a runner of {@link fitgoodies.runners}.
</p>

<p>
    Example:
</p>

<table border="1">
    <tr>
        <td>fitgoodies.alias.SetupFixture</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>myFixture</td>
        <td>org.example.fixture.MyOwnFixture</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>Now you can use:</p>

<table border="1">
    <tr>
        <td>myFixture</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>...</td>
        <td>...</td>
        <td>...</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>...</td>
        <td>...</td>
        <td>...</td>
    </tr>
</table>
