<p>
    Runners are tools which process single or multiple HTML files, generate
    the typical colorized output and write summaries.
</p>

<p>
    If an input table uses the alias feature, it is required to use a runner of this
    package.
</p>

<p>
    There are several runners: the {@link fitgoodies.runners.DirectoryRunner} runs all
    HTML files in a given directory, including its children. The
    {@link fitgoodies.runners.FileRunner} is like the original fit FileRunner and
    runs a single file.
